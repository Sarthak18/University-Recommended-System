We used the trained classifier to classify the data. We used logistic regression and SVM as classifiers. 
Then we find the similarity between the positive tweet and the advertisement tweets.
Based on this similarity,the system will recommend the user with relevant advertisement regarding university and their application

Pearson correlation is used to check the similairty between the points. we have used pearson value as 04 and if it is greater than 0.4 then it will be recommended to the user.

positive_prediction gives us the relevant tweets.
negative_prediction gives us irrelevant tweets.
advertisement_prediction gives us the advertisements.

Recommendations gives us the recmmended results.
